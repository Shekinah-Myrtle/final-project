Sustainable Construction Materials Analysis 

This project automates the analysis of sustainable construction materials using Python. It processes raw material data, cleans and analyzes key environmental metrics, and generates multiple Excel files as outputs, including a **final cleaned dataset**.

 Project Overview

The code performs:
- Data cleaning from the original Excel dataset (ICE Database + custom inputs)
Plots for various materials like bar graphs and radar plots for:
  - Embodied Carbon (kgCO₂e/kg)
  - Embodied Energy (MJ/kg or kWh)
  - Cost-effectiveness
  - Recyclability Index
  - Lifespan
- Comparative analysis across materials
- Visualization-ready outputs
- 
** Output Files**

The script generates the following Excel files:
- `raw_data_processed.xlsx` – Cleaned version of the original dataset
- `metrics_analysis.xlsx` – Key metrics computed per material
- `visualization_data.xlsx` – Data prepared for graphs and charts
- `final_cleaned_data.xlsx` – **Final cleaned and processed datasetfor analysis and visualization**
